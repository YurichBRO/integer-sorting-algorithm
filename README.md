Yeah, this is an another sorting algorithm. Made by me)

## Usage and restrictions
Algorithm should be used for integer arrays, otherwise exceptions can be
raised. For arrays with large gaps between min and max values can cause
`MemoryError`.

## Perfomance and time complexity
Shows better perfomance for arrays with small gap between min and max values.
Can be used for giant arrays, memory usage doesn't depend on the size of
array. I'm not sure about its time complexity, but I think it's O(n). You 
can test it with tests provided in file.
